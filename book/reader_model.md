# Target Reader Definition

This file defines who the book is for as a set of motivations, constraints, and failure modes. Agents must write to this reader.

---

## 1. The Reader Is Not One Ideology

The target reader is plural, but not incoherent.

This book is written for people who might disagree with each other today but could become aligned under a better system.

The reader may arrive identifying as:
- libertarian
- progressive
- socialist
- market-oriented reformer
- institutional skeptic
- systems thinker without a label

The book does not ask them to abandon their values. It shows:
- which of their values are already compatible,
- which conflicts are artifacts of the current system,
- and why those conflicts dissolve under a different economic architecture.

---

## 2. Core Shared Traits

All target readers share the following:
- They believe incentives matter more than intentions.
- They are dissatisfied with moralized economic arguments.
- They believe the current system produces instability, rewards the wrong behaviors, and traps people into defensive ideologies.
- They are willing to follow an argument if it is mechanical and coherent.
- They want a system that works without requiring everyone to be virtuous, scales without constant political warfare, and reduces dependency on fragile institutions.

If a passage would only persuade someone who already agrees politically, it is wrong for this book.

---

## 3. The Libertarian Reader (Explicitly Included)

They want maximum personal independence, distrust discretionary government power, oppose taxes on labor/exchange/production, and want predictable property rules.

This book must make it clear:
- Exclusive use is preserved.
- Production is not penalized.
- Exchange is not targeted.
- Personal initiative remains rewarded.
- The system reduces the need for bureaucratic discretion.

The book must never frame itself as abolishing ownership, punishing success, or replacing markets with planning.

If the libertarian reader feels attacked, the prose has failed.

---

## 4. The Socialist / Progressive Reader (Explicitly Included)

They want a real financial floor, see inequality as structural, distrust narratives that justify unearned wealth, and want redistribution to feel earned rather than arbitrary.

This book must make it clear:
- Shared wealth comes from non-produced inputs.
- The floor is funded mechanically, not morally.
- The system does not depend on constant taxation fights.
- Universal benefits emerge from structure, not charity.

If the progressive reader feels this is just “markets with nicer language,” the prose has failed.

---

## 5. The Reconciliation Reader (The True Center)

They believe:
> “Both sides are reacting to real problems, but the fight itself is a dead end.”

They suspect libertarians are right about incentives and state capture, progressives are right about structural extraction and insecurity, and neither can win under the current rules.

This book exists for that reader. Its job is to show:
- why the conflict persists,
- which parts of each worldview are responses to the same mechanism,
- and how a different structure makes the conflict unnecessary.

---

## 6. What the Reader Is Not

The book is not written for:
- people seeking moral validation,
- readers who want villains,
- readers who want detailed policy blueprints,
- readers who want statistical evidence,
- readers who want empirical debates before conceptual clarity,
- readers who want to classify the system ideologically.

Agents must avoid writing to impress academics or activists.

Clarity beats cleverness. Precision beats performance.

---

## 7. Reader Expectations of Tone

The reader expects the voice to be:
- calm
- confident
- non-performative
- mechanically precise
- ideologically unthreatening

The reader does not want lectures, rhetorical dominance, or authorial self-awareness.

The prose should feel like:
> “Someone explaining something clearly because it matters, not because they want credit.”

---

## 8. Success Criterion (For Agents)

A passage succeeds if a reader can think:
- “I don’t agree with everything yet, but this explains something I couldn’t explain before.”
- “This doesn’t attack my values; it rearranges the problem.”
- “I can see how people who disagree with me on other things could agree with me on this.”

If a passage pushes the reader to defend an identity, it has failed.

---

## 9. Reader Starting Beliefs (Baseline Assumptions)

These are pre-ideological intuitions the reader holds before opening the book.

1. “The economy is producing outcomes that feel disconnected from effort and contribution.”
2. “The current political camps are talking past each other.”
3. “Any real solution must be structural, not moral.”

---

## 10. The One Fear That Would Make Them Reject the Book

Fear:
> “This is just another ideological project disguised as neutral analysis.”

If the reader suspects manipulation or an ideological bait-and-switch, trust collapses before they evaluate the mechanism.
