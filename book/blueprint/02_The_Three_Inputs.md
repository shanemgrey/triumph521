# Chapter 02 Spec — The Three Inputs

## Chapter
- Number: 02
- Working title: The Three Inputs
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Define the primitives: **Nature**, **Civilization**, and **Labor** as the three necessary inputs to production, and show why confusing them creates bad economics and bad politics.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader senses “something is mispriced” but lacks a clean model.
- Exit: The reader can separate nature/civilization/labor and anticipates different rules for each category.

## Must Include
- A simple thought experiment contrasting: an identical person in empty land vs in a thriving city.
- Clear, non-ideological definitions of the three inputs.
- The rule of thumb: if a value is not produced by an individual, it cannot be fully credited to an individual.

## Must Not Include
- No policy mechanics yet (no LEF/dividend/people’s budget).
- No moral language (“deserved/undeserved”) beyond category clarity.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-001`: nature/civilization/labor framing as the basis for clear reasoning.

## Evidence Plan
- Mechanism reasoning + thought experiments; avoid empirical disputes.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Nature, Civilization, Labor.
- Safe to use: incentives, production.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Why “value” arguments fail without primitives
2. Nature: non-produced scarcity inputs
3. Civilization: collectively produced substrate
4. Labor: individually attributable effort
5. The category-error test: “Which input is paying this income?”

## Transition Requirements
- Bridge forward: if these inputs differ, **ownership and payment rules** must differ.
- Set up: commons as an accounting category (Chapter 03).

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Production requires nature, civilization, and labor.
- These inputs are categorically different.
- Labor is individually attributable; nature and civilization are not.
- Confusing the categories causes persistent policy failure.
- We need an accounting system that matches the categories.
