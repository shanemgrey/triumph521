# Chapter 10 Spec — The Land Exclusion Fee (LEF)

## Chapter
- Number: 10
- Working title: The Land Exclusion Fee (LEF)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Explain LEF at a conceptual level: a recurring price on land exclusion (not improvements) designed to push land transfer value toward zero and reward utilization.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader accepts the inversion but is anxious about “property taxes” and housing shocks.
- Exit: The reader understands the land/improvements split and why LEF targets speculative land value, not productive construction.

## Must Include
- The separation: land vs improvements (buildings).
- The objective: land transfer value trends toward zero because the rent stream is captured.
- A conceptual “signal”: some land should remain available at the fee (land availability buffer) to indicate pricing is near the zero-transfer target.

## Must Not Include
- No full algorithmic valuation details (Book Two).
- No jurisdiction-specific parameter prescriptions.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-004`: LEF is designed to capture land rent and drive transfer value toward zero.
- `C-005`: valuation can be algorithmic/auditable (preview only).

## Evidence Plan
- Thought experiments: two equal houses different locations; removing land windfall changes what buyers pay for.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: LEF (formal label), Improvements (if not already).
- Safe to use: rent, exclusion, commons.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Why land is different (fixed supply)
2. Improvements are produced; land is not
3. What LEF changes in incentives (hold vs use, speculation vs production)
4. The “near-zero transfer value” target and the buffer intuition

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- LEF is the recurring price of excluding others from land.
- Improvements are not the base; land is.
- Capturing the rent stream drives land transfer value down.
- Incentives shift from holding to using productively.
- Book Two contains valuation and adjustment mechanics.
