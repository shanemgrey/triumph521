# Book Two Module 09 Spec — Biodiversity

## Module
- Number: 09
- Topic: Biodiversity
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Land managers, agriculture, forestry, conservation, and long-run ecological resilience.

## Prerequisites
- Externality fees; measurement humility; “what we refuse to pretend to measure”.

## Module Job
Define how biodiversity can be protected within the framework using measurable proxies and hard constraints, while explicitly acknowledging measurement limits.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Biodiversity is hard to meter directly; rely on proxies and protection zones.
- Enforcement capacity and auditability matter more than “perfect metrics”.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Prefer:
  - hard constraints (protected areas),
  - externality fees for measurable destruction/depletion,
  - explicit “measurement humility” where proxies are weak.

## Mechanism Summary
- Define what is priced (measurable damage/depletion) and what is protected by rule (hard constraints).
- Route revenues through dividend-first if framed as commons compensation.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Gaming proxies; offset fraud; discretionary overrides.
- Safeguards: transparency, independent verification, simple rules.
