# Chapter 13 Spec — Transition Without Chaos

## Chapter
- Number: 13
- Working title: Transition Without Chaos
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Describe the stable-state glide path conceptually: sequencing, compensation tools, and “don’t break trust” constraints—without prescribing a single political plan.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader accepts the end state but fears the transition is impossible.
- Exit: The reader sees a plausible glide path with clear design constraints and a menu of options.

## Must Include
- Dividend-first ordering as a trust constraint.
- Compensation logic for legacy land/resource rightsholders (transition bonds as one tool).
- Sequencing: build rent capture + dividend + people’s budget, then reduce productive taxes as functions are replaced.

## Must Not Include
- No pretending transition is painless or universal.
- No electoral strategy advice.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-011`: compensatory transition can reduce resistance while preserving end-state incentives.

## Evidence Plan
- Political-economy reasoning; keep empirical claims minimal.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Transition bonds, Glide path.
- Safe to use: dividend-first rule, People’s Budget.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Why transition is the hard part
2. Non-negotiables: dividend-first, auditability, no productive taxes as end state
3. Compensation as engineering, not moral debate
4. Sequencing and rate-of-change caps (parameters)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Transition must preserve trust and predictability.
- Dividend-first prevents capture and builds legitimacy.
- Compensation tools can reduce resistance.
- Taxes fall as rent capture and citizen budgeting replace functions.
- Greenfield adoption is different (next chapter).
