# Chapter 12 Spec — No Taxes on Productivity

## Chapter
- Number: 12
- Working title: No Taxes on Productivity
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Make the end state explicit: eliminate taxes on productive activity and fund public needs through commons fees, while placing externality and risk fees inside the same framework.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader sees how rent capture funds dividends, but doubts tax elimination is realistic.
- Exit: The reader understands the logic of tax replacement (and the allowed-fee boundaries) without expecting guaranteed forecasts.

## Must Include
- A crisp definition of “productive activity” vs “commons usage”.
- A short section that introduces the glossary model **“Compounding productive capacity (model)”** and uses it to explain:
  - why taxes on productive activity reduce reinvestment into tools/skills/durable capital (reducing compounding over time), and
  - why pricing exclusion/usage/damage does not penalize productive compounding the same way.
  - Include one short example of chain-extending spending (default: tools/training/infrastructure) and one short example of non-compounding spending (default: a large diamond).
  - Explicitly warn against moralized “luxury shaming” language; the point is structural over time, not aesthetic judgment about consumption.
- A dedicated “tax vs commons fee” contrast section using the glossary definitions (`Tax`, `Commons fee`) in calm, non-moral language.
- At least one concrete micro-example contrasting a productive tax with a commons fee (no numbers required), preferably:
  - income tax: reducing the payment can mean earning less (producing less)
  - land exclusion fee: reducing the payment can mean excluding less (choosing less scarce/prime land)
- The allowed fee categories: usage/service, externality, risk (and why they are not productive taxes).
- A non-prescriptive stance: this defines structure and parameters, not “the policy”.

## Must Not Include
- No guaranteed macro promises (“GDP will rise”, etc.) without evidence.
- No jargon-heavy public finance argumentation.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-009`: no productive taxes as the end state with transition logic.
- `C-016`: externality and risk fees fit when measurable and rule-bound.
- `C-020`: taxes vs commons fees are conceptually distinct; the distinction is central to legitimacy.
- `C-021`: compounding productive capacity helps explain why productive taxes are uniquely harmful over time.

## Evidence Plan
- Incentive reasoning: distortion from taxing production; transparency from pricing commons usage.
- Time-based model + thought experiments: compounding productive capacity clarifies why productive taxes cause compounding harm.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Productive activity, Compounding productive capacity (model), Tax, Commons fee, Externality fee, Risk fee.
- Safe to use: LEF, resource rent.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Compounding productive capacity: why taxing production is uniquely damaging
2. Tax vs commons fee: what the words mean and why the distinction matters
3. What replaces taxes: pricing commons usage and exclusion
4. Externality and risk fees as scoped commons-cost internalization
5. What this does to political conflict (preview)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Productive activity should not be taxed in the end state; compounding productive capacity explains why.
- Commons usage should be priced through fees.
- Usage/externality/risk fees are allowed when measurable and rule-bound.
- The system defines structure, not jurisdiction-specific parameters.
- Next: how to transition without shocks.
