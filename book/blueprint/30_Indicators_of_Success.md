# Implementation Module 30 Spec — Indicators of Success

## Module
- Number: 30
- Topic: Indicators of Success
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Citizens, policymakers, and anyone evaluating whether the system is working.

## Prerequisites (Minimal)
- From Part I: rent vs production, dividend-first rule, People’s Budget (as feedback loop).
- Glossary terms used here: productive activity, rent, poverty (book definition).

## Module Job (non-overlapping)
Define how the economic system detects whether it is functioning correctly, using internal feedback rather than political declarations or aggregate activity metrics.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Money flow alone is not evidence of success.
- Persistence of productive capacity is.
- Political declarations are not an indicator class.
- Aggregate activity metrics are not primary validators (e.g., raw GDP/total spend/asset prices).

## Mechanism Summary

### Principle
The system is working when productive capacity, ecological capacity, and human security **increase together over time**, and when misallocation corrects without crisis.

### Indicator Classes

#### 1. Productive Chain Extension
*Is today’s work making tomorrow’s work easier?*

- Net productive capital per capita
- Median labor productivity growth
- Reinvestment-to-consumption ratio (excluding status goods)
- Rate of skill and tool accumulation

**Failure signal:** productivity gains concentrate without expanding capacity.

#### 2. Rent vs Labor Share
*Is surplus flowing to production or extraction?*

- Labor share of income (median-weighted)
- Economic rent as % of total income
- Price-to-income ratios of non-produced assets
- Profit share attributable to exclusivity

**Failure signal:** rising rents with stagnant productivity.

#### 3. Productive Entry Accessibility
*Can new participants enter without permission from rent holders?*

- Startup capital required vs median income
- Time to operational break-even
- Land access cost vs productive yield
- Small-firm formation and survival rates

**Failure signal:** increasing barriers to entry.

#### 4. Ecological Balance
*Is the economy living off income or principal?*

- Net ecosystem restoration vs extraction
- Material throughput per unit of wellbeing
- Net carbon drawdown
- Biodiversity recovery

**Failure signal:** growth dependent on ecological depletion.

#### 5. Human Stress & Fragility
*Does the system push short-term survival behavior?*

- Median household financial slack
- Essential price volatility
- Work hours required for basic security
- Stress-driven migration

**Failure signal:** rising precarity and short planning horizons.

#### 6. Status & Attention Allocation
*Does signaling outperform problem-solving?*

- Share of surplus spent on positional goods
- Returns to attention monopolies vs production
- Luxury dissipation vs public investment
- Reward gap between signaling and solving

**Failure signal:** visible waste outcompetes productive investment.

#### 7. Self-Correction Speed (Meta-Indicator)
*How fast does the system correct misallocation without crisis?*

- Time for bubbles to deflate without mass unemployment
- Capital reallocation speed after shocks
- Price responsiveness to real scarcity

**Failure signal:** errors amplify instead of self-correct.

## Success Condition (Summary)

The system is on track when:
- productive chains lengthen,
- rents shrink,
- ecological repair outpaces damage,
- human stress declines,
- and misallocation corrects without coercion.

If these conditions hold, the system does not require ideological defense—its outcomes validate it.
