# Implementation Module 20 Spec — Fresh Water

## Module
- Number: 20
- Topic: Fresh Water
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Farmers, utilities, industry, households, and ecosystems.

## Prerequisites
- Commons usage, externality fees, metering constraints, and local enforcement reality.

## Module Job
Describe fee structures for water extraction and water pollution as commons usage, with explicit attention to measurement limits and ecological thresholds.

## Inputs / Measurability
- What can be metered: withdrawal volumes (where meters exist), reservoir releases, utility distribution.
- What is hard: groundwater extraction, illegal wells, shared aquifers, seasonal variability.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Water behaves like a metered commons in some contexts and like a scarce access right in others.
- Use a mix:
  - metered usage fees where measurement is feasible,
  - access rights/allocations where it is not,
  - externality fees for pollution where measurable.

## Mechanism Summary
- Define the unit of control (basin/aquifer).
- Define eligibility and priority rules (policy choice) separately from pricing structure.
- Route all collected rents/fees through the dividend-first flow if they are commons rents.

## Tunable Parameters
- Drought triggers, caps, tiering rules (avoid turning into a disguised productive tax).

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Local corruption → decentralize measurement and publish audits.
- Over-extraction and collapse → enforceable hard limits where necessary.

## Interfaces
- LRA may coordinate with basin authorities; enforcement assumptions must be explicit.
