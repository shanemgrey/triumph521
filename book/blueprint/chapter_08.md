# Chapter 08 Spec — Compensation: The Citizen Dividend

## Chapter
- Number: 08
- Working title: Compensation: The Citizen Dividend
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Define the Citizen Dividend as compensation for exclusion from the commons and show why it builds legitimacy and stability without moralizing.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader accepts “price exclusion” but may worry it becomes government revenue or welfare politics.
- Exit: The reader sees a clean value flow: rents → equal dividend, paid first.

## Must Include
- Compensation logic: if exclusion is enforced, the excluded are owed compensation.
- Why equal per-capita distribution matters (simplicity, legitimacy, anti-capture).
- The dividend-first intuition (paid before budgeting).

## Must Not Include
- Do not argue “it ends poverty” as a guaranteed empirical claim.
- Avoid framing as UBI; allow comparison but keep distinctions clear.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-006`: dividend as conversion of scarcity rents into shared income.

## Evidence Plan
- Accounting logic + thought experiments (scarcity price rises → dividend rises).

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Citizen Dividend.
- Safe to use: commons, exclusion, rent.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Compensation vs charity
2. Why equal distribution is structurally important
3. The visibility/trust effect of dividend-first ordering (preview)
4. Bridge: if citizens are paid first, how is government funded? (Chapter 09)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Exclusion implies compensation to those excluded.
- Captured rents flow into a citizen dividend.
- Equal per-capita distribution is simple and anti-capture.
- Pay the dividend first to keep trust and visibility.
- Next: fund government from citizens (People’s Budget).
