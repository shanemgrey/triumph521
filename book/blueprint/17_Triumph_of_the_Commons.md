# Chapter 17 Spec — Triumph of the Commons

## Chapter
- Number: 17
- Working title: Triumph of the Commons
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Deliver the synthesis and final impression, tie the arc together, and include an “edge of AI” section as a forward-looking design agenda—then hand off to Part II.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader understands the architecture and objections but needs closure and a “why now”.
- Exit: The reader holds the lens, sees the system as inevitable in hindsight, and is motivated to explore Part II modules (optional) or to advocate for the architecture.

## Must Include
- Synthesis: the accounting error → inversion principle → dividend + people’s budget → no productive taxes.
- A clear “what stays / what changes” summary.
- The AI section (not the whole chapter): why the system is necessary groundwork for a future without work; what remains open.
- A clear ending for Part I: the main argument is complete; the reader can stop here.
- A handoff: how to use Part II (optional, read in any order; jump by domain) and how to extend the system.

## Must Not Include
- No utopian promises; keep tone calm and precise.
- Avoid doom or inevitability theater; keep it as incentives and risk management.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-014`: AI/robotics concentration risk as an open design space.

## Evidence Plan
- Scenario analysis + mechanism reasoning; explicitly mark open items as open.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: none required.
- Safe to use: all core terms; keep definitions stable for translation.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. The lens: what you can’t unsee now
2. The architecture in one diagram (textual description for now)
3. What stays / what changes
4. Edge of AI section: concentration risk and extension directions
5. Handoff to Part II: implementable modules and adoption paths (optional; jump by domain)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- The book corrects one accounting error: mispriced exclusion.
- Price exclusion, pay the dividend, fund government via citizens, tax production never.
- The system is robust because it works with imperfect people and weak trust.
- AI may shift what counts as the commons; this is a tracked open problem.
- Part II is the implementation kit; start where your domain touches the commons.
