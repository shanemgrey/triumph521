# Chapter 16 Spec — Objections and Hostile Paraphrases

## Chapter
- Number: 16
- Working title: Objections and Hostile Paraphrases
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Preempt the most dangerous misreadings and objections (from multiple ideologies) and answer them using mechanisms, constraints, and invariants—not motives.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader believes the core design but anticipates backlash or misclassification.
- Exit: The reader can explain the system in adversarial environments without triggering identity defenses.

## Must Include
- Hostile paraphrase responses (mechanism-first):
  - “It’s socialism/UBI.” (distinguish: pricing exclusion + dividend as compensation)
  - “It’s a property tax.” (distinguish: LEF targets land rent; improvements excluded)
  - “It’s anti-market.” (show markets remain; rent capture is the change)
  - “It will cause chaos.” (glide path + caps + auditability)
  - “Migration will overwhelm it.” (citizenship definition as polity choice)
- A short “how to explain it in 90 seconds” scaffold.

## Must Not Include
- No snark, no rhetorical dominance, no ideology labeling as an argument.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- Supporting chapter (no new claims; reinforces hostile paraphrase resilience).

## Evidence Plan
- Mechanism reasoning only; avoid arguing via “examples of failure”.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: none.
- Safe to use: all core terms, but keep definitions consistent and translation-friendly.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. The two failure modes of communication: ideology bait and moral bait
2. Objections from the right (property, markets, state discretion)
3. Objections from the left (security floor, inequality, capture)
4. The 90-second explanation scaffold

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Most objections are misreadings of the mechanism.
- Answer with constraints, not motives.
- Distinguish fees on exclusion from taxes on production.
- Preserve markets and title; remove rent capture.
- End with a repeatable, hostile-paraphrase-resistant summary.
