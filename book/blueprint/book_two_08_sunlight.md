# Book Two Module 08 Spec — Sunlight

## Module
- Number: 08
- Topic: Sunlight
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Solar generation, landholders in high-insolation regions, and grid operators.

## Prerequisites
- Distinguish “abundant commons” from “scarce/excludable capture” cases.

## Module Job
Clarify when sunlight is worth pricing as a commons capture (rare) versus when it is effectively free and should be treated as a land/improvements issue.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Insolation is measurable, but exclusion is typically via land control and infrastructure.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Default: sunlight is not directly priced; land exclusion and infrastructure access capture the relevant scarcity.
- Only price directly if a clear, excludable, scarce sunlight capture mechanism exists and can be metered without creating a new corruption surface.

## Mechanism Summary
- Show the decision rule: “meter only when scarce, excludable, and measurable”.
- Otherwise treat solar as improvements on land and apply LEF via land.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Overengineering: pricing everything creates more discretion than it removes.
