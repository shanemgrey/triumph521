# Chapter 01 Spec — The Broken Reward Signal

## Chapter
- Number: 01
- Working title: The Broken Reward Signal
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Establish that the problem is structural (not moral), set the “treat the economy like engineering” stance, and earn trust by stating the book’s constraints and method.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader feels the economy is “off” (effort and reward don’t line up) and expects ideological messaging.
- Exit: The reader accepts a mechanics-first investigation and wants clear primitives and a new accounting.

## Must Include
- Recognition of shared observations (instability, misaligned rewards, defensive politics) without naming villains.
- The promise: incentives over intentions; no moral coercion; no ideological bait-and-switch.
- The method: define primitives → identify the distortion → invert the incentives → show implementable modules.
- The two-part structure: Part I (conceptual journey) + Part II (optional implementation modules; read in any order).
- A brief bridge from the Prologue: “we started with a destination; now we earn it by diagnosing the mechanics.”

## Must Not Include
- No policy “solution dump” yet (no detailed fees, no algorithms, no implementation chapters).
- No naming the system components yet (avoid `LEF`, dividend, People’s Budget); keep language generic and effects-first.
- No empirical debates or statistics as persuasion anchors.
- No idioms/wordplay that translate poorly.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-002` (preview only): there is a structural difference between income from production and income from exclusion.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: none formally.
- Safe to use (plain-language only): incentives, mechanisms, exclusion (informal), rent (informal).

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Bridge from the Prologue: the destination is real, but it will require a full mechanics redesign
2. The shared unease: outcomes feel disconnected from contribution
3. Why moral explanations fail: incentives dominate intentions
4. The engineering stance: we’re looking for the “reward signal” bug
5. The roadmap: primitives → distortion → inversion → architecture → adoption paths
6. How to read the book: Part I in order; Part II optional modules (jump by domain)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- The problem is structural, not moral.
- Incentives explain persistent failure better than ideology does.
- We will define clear primitives and follow value flows.
- The solution shape is “charge exclusion, not productive activity”.
- Part II is where mechanisms live; Part I builds the lens.
