# Implementation Module 32 Spec — Adoption Paths

## Module
- Number: 32
- Topic: Greenfield adoption vs glide-path transition
- Target length: ~2,500–3,500 words (may need more than average)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Reformers in stable states and builders of new governance in rebuilding/failed states.

## Prerequisites
- Dividend-first, LEF, People’s Budget, and the “no productive taxes” end state.

## Module Job
Provide concrete adoption procedures (not “the policy”) for both greenfield and stable-state transition, including assumptions, sequences, and failure modes.

## Greenfield Procedure (Minimum Viable, Low-Data)
This path is designed to work without mature “comparable sales” datasets; auctions and published rules provide the primary price signals.

1. Assumptions: citizen ID, payments rails, enforcement/courts, land registry.
2. Adopt the ordering rule: route commons revenue to an equal per-capita dividend first, then to budgeting.
3. Land rights: allocate via competitive auctions for annual LEF payments (security of exclusive use; no discretionary parcel assessments).
4. Adjustment rule: contracts state annual fee updates are algorithmic with a change-cap anchor (example: CPI + 10%).
5. Land pricing signals:
   - Availability buffer (some land remains available at the posted fee).
   - Too low (transfer value reappears).
   - Too high (too much unused land; improved parcels trade below improvement value).
6. Resources: implement rent capture with simple, auditable rules first; expand as governance capacity grows.
7. Dividend: predictable cadence (cadence is a parameter; dividend-first ordering is not).
8. People’s Budget: begin with annual size vote + coarse allocation; increase granularity over time.

## Glide-Path Procedure (Stable States)
- Sequence: establish rent capture + dividend-first flow → build People’s Budget → reduce productive taxes as functions are replaced.
- Compensation tools: transition bonds and other mechanisms; warn about exemptions and discretionary carve-outs.
- Rate-of-change caps: explain why caps exist and the failure modes of removing them.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- The “exemptions metastasize” failure mode.
- The “dividend diversion” failure mode.
- The “discretion returns” failure mode.
