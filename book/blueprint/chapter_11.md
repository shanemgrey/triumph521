# Chapter 11 Spec — Resource Rents

## Chapter
- Number: 11
- Working title: Resource Rents
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Extend the framework to natural resources and preview why different commons categories need different fee structures (finite vs regenerative; stock vs flow; measurability).

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader sees LEF and wonders if the same mechanism applies everywhere.
- Exit: The reader understands “same principle, different fee structures” and is ready for Book Two’s taxonomy.

## Must Include
- The difference between finite extractive resources and regenerative resources.
- The sustainability angle: pricing commons usage can reduce throughput and waste without taxing work.
- A clear boundary: Part I gives intuition; Book Two gives mechanisms.

## Must Not Include
- No heavy industrial-organization math.
- Avoid claiming precise ecological outcomes as guaranteed.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-010`: finite resources can be priced to capture rent and reduce throughput (intuition here).
- `C-015`: fee structure must match category/measurability.

## Evidence Plan
- Thought experiments: what happens when extraction is priced as a commons lease vs as private windfall.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Resource rent (formal definition if not already used).
- Safe to use: LEF, Citizen Dividend, People’s Budget.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Resource rents: what is being priced (exclusion + scarcity)
2. Finite resources: rent capture vs throughput incentives
3. Regenerative resources: why the structure changes
4. The promise of Book Two: domain modules you can jump to

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Resources generate rents just like land does.
- Finite and regenerative resources behave differently.
- Pricing commons usage can reduce waste and harm.
- Same principle, different fee structures.
- Book Two provides domain-by-domain mechanisms.
