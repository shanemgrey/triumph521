# Chapter 07 Spec — The Inversion Principle

## Chapter
- Number: 07
- Working title: The Inversion Principle
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Introduce the core inversion: **charge exclusion, not productive activity**—and show why this is the smallest structural correction that changes everything downstream.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader believes structural change is needed but expects it to be radical/ideological.
- Exit: The reader sees a simple rule that preserves markets while removing the distortion.

## Must Include
- The principle statement in one sentence.
- Why this preserves ownership/markets while changing what gets priced.
- A preview of the three pillars: LEF + Citizen Dividend + People’s Budget.

## Must Not Include
- No detailed mechanisms yet; keep to “shape of the system”.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-004` (conceptual setup): pricing land exclusion is designed to capture land rent.

## Evidence Plan
- Thought experiments: what happens when holding costs apply to exclusion; what incentives flip.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: none formally (LEF/dividend/budget names can appear as labels only).
- Safe to use: exclusion, productive activity (plain language).

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. What must be free vs what must be priced
2. The inversion: price exclusion, free production
3. Why this is not “anti-market”
4. The three-pillar preview

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- The distortion is mispricing exclusion and taxing production.
- Fix it by charging exclusion and freeing productive activity.
- This preserves markets and private title.
- It changes incentives without demanding virtue.
- Next: what compensation looks like (the dividend).
