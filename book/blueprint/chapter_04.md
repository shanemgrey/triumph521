# Chapter 04 Spec — Property Is Exclusion

## Chapter
- Number: 04
- Working title: Property Is Exclusion
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Make **exclusion** legible as the core mechanism of property (without moralizing) and show why exclusion can be priced without abolishing ownership.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader accepts “commons value exists” but still thinks in moral/identity frames about ownership.
- Exit: The reader can describe property as enforceable exclusion and sees why exclusion implies compensation.

## Must Include
- The definition: ownership/title is a socially enforced right to exclude.
- The idea that exclusion is a “service” provided by institutions (courts/enforcement).
- The neutrality: exclusion is a mechanism; pricing it is accounting, not punishment.

## Must Not Include
- No “land back” rhetoric; no activist framing.
- No deep fee mechanics yet.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-002` (setup): exclusion-based income differs structurally from production income.

## Evidence Plan
- Thought experiments: what changes if enforcement disappears; the asset changes because exclusion changes.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Exclusion (formal definition).
- Safe to use: Commons, property/title (plain language).

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Property is a “no” before it is a “mine”
2. Exclusion as an institutional product (rule of law)
3. Why exclusion creates a priceable external claim
4. Bridge: exclusion value becomes rent (Chapter 05)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Property is enforceable exclusion.
- Exclusion depends on institutions, not personal virtue.
- Pricing exclusion is compatible with private title.
- The mechanism is neutral; the accounting can be mechanical.
- Next: rent is income from exclusion.
