# Book Two Module 05 Spec — Atmosphere

## Module
- Number: 05
- Topic: Atmosphere (pollution/emissions)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Energy producers, industry, logistics, households, and public health/ecosystems.

## Prerequisites
- Externality fees; measurement humility; “no productive taxes” boundary.

## Module Job
Define atmosphere-related externality fees as measurable commons damage pricing, and show how they fit the framework without becoming a general tax.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Meterable: point-source emissions, fuel inputs (as proxy), particulate monitoring.
- Hard: diffuse sources, enforcement capacity.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Atmosphere is a commons externality domain: use externality fees when measurement is credible.
- Where measurement is weak, prefer coarse proxies + transparent error bounds over discretionary enforcement.

## Mechanism Summary
- Define what is priced (emissions, pollutants) and what is not claimed.
- Route revenues through dividend-first flow if framed as commons usage compensation.
- Avoid complex offset markets unless the measurement integrity can be defended.

## Tunable Parameters
- Measurement thresholds, proxy choices, and cap structures (policy choices).

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Gaming offsets and proxies.
- Regressivity concerns: addressed structurally via dividend-first distribution.
