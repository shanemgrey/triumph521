# Book Two Module 04 Spec — Durable Materials

## Module
- Number: 04
- Topic: Durable Materials (metals/minerals)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Mining, manufacturing, recycling industries, and strategic supply chains.

## Prerequisites
- Finite extractive resource rent logic; stock vs flow distinction.

## Module Job
Specify how to capture scarcity rent from durable finite materials while aligning incentives for recycling and long-run material stewardship.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Meterable: extraction volumes, grades, exports.
- Hard: informal mining, conflict zones, illicit trade.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Treat primary extraction as finite-resource rent capture.
- Recognize durability: long-run value depends on circulation and recovery, not just extraction.

## Mechanism Summary
- Rent capture at extraction/first sale.
- Incentive compatibility with recycling (avoid double-charging recovered material as if newly extracted).
- Enforcement realities and audit trails.

## Tunable Parameters
- Royalties/lease terms as structure; rate levels as polity choice.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Illicit extraction → governance constraint, not a pricing detail.
- Exemptions for “strategic materials” → high capture risk; warn explicitly.

## Interfaces
- LRA or delegated resource authority; dividend-first routing.
