# Chapter 06 Spec — Why Politics Can’t Fix It

## Chapter
- Number: 06
- Working title: Why Politics Can’t Fix It
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Explain why the current system produces endless moralized conflict and why “partial fixes” fail: rent capture turns politics into capture.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader now sees rent but may assume better policies or better leaders can fix it.
- Exit: The reader understands why the conflict persists and why a structural inversion is required.

## Must Include
- The recurring loop: rent → inequality/insecurity → polarization → capture.
- Why labor taxes distort and don’t touch rent.
- Why welfare and anti-corruption campaigns treat symptoms and become captured.

## Must Not Include
- No “both sides are evil”; keep it mechanical and charitable.
- No detailed alternative architecture yet.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-013`: primary failure modes (exemptions, tampering, diversion/capture) as the pattern to avoid.

## Evidence Plan
- Mechanism reasoning: incentives for lobbying, exemptions, and loopholes.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: none required.
- Safe to use: rent, exclusion, commons.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Why the conflict is stable (not accidental)
2. Why productive taxes are the wrong lever
3. Why “cleaner government” doesn’t survive incentives
4. The requirement: change what is priced and what is free

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Rent capture makes politics a battle for the rent stream.
- Taxing production doesn’t fix rent; it distorts work.
- Welfare and anti-corruption don’t remove the incentive.
- Partial reforms get exemptions and loopholes.
- We need an incentive inversion, not better intentions.
