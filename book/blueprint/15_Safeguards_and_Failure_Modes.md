# Chapter 15 Spec — Safeguards and Failure Modes

## Chapter
- Number: 15
- Working title: Safeguards and Failure Modes
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Define the primary failure modes (exemptions, tampering, dividend diversion) and the non-negotiable safeguards (transparency, auditability, dividend-first).

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader is convinced by the logic but worries “it will be corrupted”.
- Exit: The reader can name the failure modes, the safeguards, and the observable warning signs.

## Must Include
- Failure mode list: exemptions, algorithm tampering, dividend diversion, discretionary overrides.
- Safeguards: dividend-first rule, public audit trails, limited discretion, independent verification.
- A clear rule: reviewers/auditors produce tickets; changes are controlled (tie to the systemized workflow).

## Must Not Include
- No false certainty (“corruption-proof”); emphasize “resistant” and “auditable”.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-013`: failure modes and safeguards are central to viability.

## Evidence Plan
- Institutional incentive analysis; avoid reliance on examples.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Dividend-First Rule (formal if not earlier).
- Safe to use: LRA, People’s Budget, LEF.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Why good ideas fail: exemptions and discretion
2. The three critical failure modes
3. Safeguards that don’t require virtue
4. Observable signals and what to do when they appear

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- The system fails through exemptions, tampering, or diversion.
- Safeguards must be structural and auditable.
- Dividend-first is a trust constraint, not a slogan.
- Transparency and limited discretion are non-negotiable.
- Next: respond to the strongest objections and hostile paraphrases.
