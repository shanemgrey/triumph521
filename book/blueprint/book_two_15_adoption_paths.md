# Book Two Module 15 Spec — Adoption Paths

## Module
- Number: 15
- Topic: Greenfield adoption vs glide-path transition
- Target length: ~2,500–3,500 words (may need more than average)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Reformers in stable states and builders of new governance in rebuilding/failed states.

## Prerequisites
- Dividend-first, LEF, People’s Budget, and the “no productive taxes” end state.

## Module Job
Provide concrete adoption procedures (not “the policy”) for both greenfield and stable-state transition, including assumptions, sequences, and failure modes.

## Greenfield Procedure (Minimum Viable)
- Assumptions: citizen ID, payments rails, enforcement/courts, land registry.
- Land: auction rights for annual LEF payments; explicit annual adjustment cap anchor (example: CPI + 10%).
- Land pricing signals: availability buffer; “too low / too high” signals.
- Resources: implement finite-resource rent capture with simple, auditable rules first; expand as capacity grows.
- Dividend: dividend-first routing; predictable cadence (cadence is a parameter).
- People’s Budget: begin with simple annual size vote + coarse allocation; increase granularity as governance capacity grows.

## Glide-Path Procedure (Stable States)
- Sequence: establish rent capture + dividend-first flow → build People’s Budget → reduce productive taxes as functions are replaced.
- Compensation tools: transition bonds and other mechanisms; warn about exemptions and discretionary carve-outs.
- Rate-of-change caps: explain why caps exist and the failure modes of removing them.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- The “exemptions metastasize” failure mode.
- The “dividend diversion” failure mode.
- The “discretion returns” failure mode.
