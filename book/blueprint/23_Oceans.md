# Implementation Module 23 Spec — Oceans

## Module
- Number: 23
- Topic: Oceans
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Fisheries, shipping, coastal communities, seabed extraction, and marine ecosystems.

## Prerequisites
- Commons enforcement constraints; regenerative resources; externality fees.

## Module Job
Specify fee structures for ocean commons usage (fisheries, seabed resources, shipping impacts) with explicit enforcement and jurisdiction constraints.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Meterable: licensed catches, vessel tracking (where available), port throughput.
- Hard: illegal fishing, piracy, weak enforcement.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Mix of access rights (licenses/auctions) and externality pricing where measurable.
- Treat ecological collapse risk as a hard constraint, not a negotiable parameter.

## Mechanism Summary
- Access rights for fisheries with renewal and audit.
- Seabed extraction treated as finite resource rent capture.
- Shipping commons impacts priced where measurable (port fees, pollution fees).

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Enforcement failure → requires coordination; module must state prerequisites.
- Rent capture diversion → dividend-first routing.
