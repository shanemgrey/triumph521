# Book Two Module 02 Spec — Hydrocarbons

## Module
- Number: 02
- Topic: Hydrocarbons (oil, gas, coal)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Extractors, refiners, utilities, heavy industry, consumers of energy, and the state’s revenue architecture.

## Prerequisites (Minimal)
- Resource rent, Citizen Dividend, Dividend-First Rule, externality fees (for emissions), and “no taxes on productivity”.

## Module Job (non-overlapping)
Specify how a polity captures hydrocarbon scarcity rent (and optionally externalities) without taxing production, and how it prevents corruption and black markets.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Meterable quantities: extraction volumes, sales volumes, import/export flows.
- Hard parts: smuggling, informal markets, political pressure for exemptions.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Finite extractive resource: rent capture must target scarcity rent and throughput.
- Distinguish two levers:
  - **Rent capture** (ownership/scarcity value).
  - **Externality pricing** (emissions/pollution) as a separate measurable commons damage fee.

## Mechanism Summary
Describe the menu (not “the policy”):
- Monopoly–monopsony pricing model (high-level intuition; formal in `archive/core_spec.md` / `archive/mechanisms.md` concepts).
- Contracted extraction vs regulated private extraction.
- Import/export handling to prevent arbitrage.
- Dividend-first routing and visible distribution to prevent diversion.

## Tunable Parameters (Not “The Policy”)
- Renewal/contract terms, enforcement strength, externality fee design and measurement.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Smuggling/black markets → requires border and audit capacity.
- Political exemptions → must be constitutionally hard.
- Data manipulation → independent audit trails and redundancy.

## Interfaces
- Collector/pricer: LRA or equivalent.
- Dividend flow: full routing through the dividend pool before budgeting.

## Notes for Translation
- Avoid culture-specific references; define “rent capture” vs “price controls” clearly.
