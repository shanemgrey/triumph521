# Chapter 09 Spec — Funding Government: The People’s Budget

## Chapter
- Number: 09
- Working title: Funding Government: The People’s Budget
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Introduce the People’s Budget as a democratic funding mechanism that reduces capture: citizens set budget size and allocate funds, instead of administrators controlling tax revenue.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader worries “the government will just take the rent stream”.
- Exit: The reader sees a funding architecture where government is structurally accountable to citizens.

## Must Include
- Two-layer design: Budget Size Vote (annual) + Allocation Vote (quarterly updates allowed).
- Why this reduces capture compared to tax-funded discretion.
- The stance: privacy is a design choice; auditability is non-negotiable.

## Must Not Include
- No implementation tech stack as the point (blockchain/ZK may be mentioned as options, not requirements).

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-008`: People’s Budget shifts accountability and reduces capture incentives.

## Evidence Plan
- Incentive analysis + thought experiments about agency competition for funding.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: People’s Budget, Budget Size Vote, Allocation Vote.
- Safe to use: Citizen Dividend, dividend-first (as ordering concept).

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Government as service: what changes when citizens pay first
2. Budget Size Vote: annual, capped change as a parameter (not “the policy”)
3. Allocation Vote: how modular allocation changes incentives
4. Auditability vs privacy: what must be public, what can be private

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Government funding should be citizen-controlled, not rent-controlled.
- People’s Budget has a size vote and an allocation vote.
- This changes incentives for agencies and reduces capture.
- Auditability is required; privacy is optional by design.
- Next: apply the inversion to land via LEF.
