# Book Two Module 12 Spec — Estate Transfer (Name TBD)

## Module
- Number: 12
- Topic: Estate transfer within the framework (name TBD)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Families, wealth holders, and long-run political legitimacy.

## Prerequisites
- Commons accounting, rent vs production, and “no taxes on productive activity”.

## Module Job
Show how an inheritance/estate recapture mechanism can fit the framework if it targets non-productive windfalls and is framed as partial commons-value recapture, not as a tax on work.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Requires identity, registries of assets, and enforceable transfer rules.
- Must acknowledge evasion and cross-border strategies.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Treat as a transfer/recapture mechanism, not a productive tax:
  - focus on windfall transfer, not production.

## Mechanism Summary
- Provide a menu of structures (not “the policy”):
  - thresholds, timing, trusts, and anti-evasion constraints.
- Show how the mechanism preserves incentives for production while limiting dynastic rent extraction.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Evasion and loopholes → simplicity and strong definitions.
- Political capture → transparency and constrained discretion.

## Interfaces
- Revenue routing: if treated as commons recapture, it follows dividend-first; if treated as general policy, it must not violate the “no productive taxes” boundary.
