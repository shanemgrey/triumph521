# Chapter 03 Spec — The Commons (as Accounting)

## Chapter
- Number: 03
- Working title: The Commons (as Accounting)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Define the **commons** as an accounting category (shared inputs + shared value) and make the “accounting error” legible: private capture of value created by nature and civilization.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader understands the three inputs but hasn’t connected them to ownership rules.
- Exit: The reader sees “commons value” as real, trackable, and currently misassigned.

## Must Include
- A clean definition of “commons” that avoids “everyone owns everything”.
- The concept of **location premium** as civilization value showing up in prices.
- The framing: the problem is not ownership; it is **uncompensated exclusion from the commons**.

## Must Not Include
- No villain framing (“landlords are evil”, etc.).
- No deep implementation; keep it conceptual.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-003`: much land/location value is socially generated and structurally miscaptured.

## Evidence Plan
- Thought experiments: identical improvements in different locations; the difference is civilization/nature, not labor.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Commons.
- Safe to use: Nature, Civilization, Labor.

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. Commons as accounting, not ideology
2. How civilization value appears as location premium
3. The ownership confusion: title vs value creation
4. The compensation principle: exclusion has a cost

## Transition Requirements
- Set up: what “property” really is in mechanism terms (Chapter 04).

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- The commons is a value category: shared inputs and shared value.
- Civilization creates location premium without individual authorship.
- Private title can exist without private capture of commons value.
- The distortion is uncompensated exclusion from shared value.
- Next: property is the mechanism of exclusion.
