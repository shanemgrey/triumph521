# Implementation Module 31 Spec — To Powerful People

## Module
- Number: 31
- Topic: A direct chapter to incumbents (“powerful people”)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Incumbent wealth and power holders, institutional gatekeepers, and their advisors.

## Prerequisites
- Full Part I conceptual arc; especially rent vs production and dividend-first legitimacy.

## Module Job
Speak directly to incumbents about transition incentives: what they give up, what they gain (stability, predictability, reduced conflict), and why cooperative transition beats forced transition.

## Mechanism Summary
- No moral indictment; frame as risk management and long-run stability.
- Emphasize: the system is designed to work without villains; resisting it can make outcomes worse for incumbents.
- Offer “how to participate” without turning into lobbying advice.

## Failure Modes
- Tone risk: this can easily become preachy or threatening; keep it calm and mechanically grounded.

## Notes for Translation
- Avoid idioms and cultural references; keep it universal and non-performative.
