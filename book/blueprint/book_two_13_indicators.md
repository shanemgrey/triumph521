# Book Two Module 13 Spec — Indicators of Success

## Module
- Number: 13
- Topic: Indicators of economic, social, and environmental success
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Policymakers, journalists, and anyone evaluating whether the system is working.

## Prerequisites
- Measurement humility; avoid “we can quantify everything”.

## Module Job
Define a bounded indicator set and a philosophy of measurement: what to track, what not to pretend to measure, and how to detect failure modes early.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Distinguish: measurable signals vs proxy metrics vs narrative-only outcomes.

## Mechanism Summary
- Provide an indicator framework template rather than a final list.
- Include failure-mode indicators (exemptions growth, diversion, corruption signals, rising land transfer values).

## Open Design Questions
- The indicator list is intentionally left open pending brainstorming and refinement (see `book/tickets.md` T-016).
