# Implementation Module 24 Spec — Radio Spectrum

## Module
- Number: 24
- Topic: Radio Spectrum
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Telecoms, broadcasters, consumers, and national security regulators.

## Prerequisites
- Scarce access rights; auctions; renewal terms.

## Module Job
Specify how spectrum rights can be allocated and priced as a scarce commons access right with low corruption surface and clear renewal rules.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Measurable: bands, geographic coverage, interference constraints.
- Enforcement: licensing and technical compliance.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Spectrum behaves like auctioned access rights with periodic renewal and fees (not like land).

## Mechanism Summary
- Competitive allocation (auction) with clear renewal and anti-capture rules.
- Fees treated as commons rent capture; route through dividend-first flow.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Regulatory capture via sweetheart renewals → enforce transparent renewal rules.
- Underutilization → use-it-or-lose-it conditions.
