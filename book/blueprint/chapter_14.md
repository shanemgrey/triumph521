# Chapter 14 Spec — Greenfield Adoption

## Chapter
- Number: 14
- Working title: Greenfield Adoption
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)

## Chapter Job (non-overlapping)
Explain how a rebuilding/failed state can adopt the architecture quickly under minimal assumptions, using auctioned land rights with algorithmic LEF adjustment toward near-zero transfer value.

## Reader Entry → Exit State
- Entry: The reader sees glide paths but wonders about places with broken legacy systems.
- Exit: The reader sees a concrete “fresh start” architecture that can be assembled quickly and audited.

## Must Include
- Minimal assumptions: citizen ID, payments rails, courts/enforcement, land registry.
- Land rights via competitive auctions for annual LEF payments; contracts state algorithmic adjustment (cap anchor: CPI + 10%).
- The “land availability buffer” signal and “too low / too high” signals at a conceptual level.

## Must Not Include
- No country-specific geopolitics; keep it a general greenfield blueprint.
- Avoid implying this fixes security issues by itself; it’s a governance/economic architecture.

## Key Claims (IDs)
- `C-018`: greenfield adoption via auctioned land rights + algorithmic LEF adjustment rules.

## Evidence Plan
- Mechanism reasoning + operational plausibility; avoid “it will work everywhere” claims.

## Glossary / Terms
- Introduce in this chapter: Greenfield adoption, LEF adjustment cap, Land availability buffer (conceptual).
- Safe to use: People’s Budget, Citizen Dividend (as architecture pieces).

## Section Plan (Outline)
1. When greenfield applies and why it matters
2. Minimal institutions and why each is required
3. Auctioned land rights + annual LEF + adjustment cap
4. Signals and safeguards: buffer, too low, too high
5. Bridge: robustness requires explicit safeguards and failure-mode thinking (Chapter 15)

## Compression Target (5 bullets)
- Greenfield adoption is a different problem than transition.
- Minimal institutions are required: ID, payments, enforcement, registry.
- Land rights can be auctioned with annual LEF payments.
- Algorithmic adjustment aims for near-zero transfer value with signals.
- Next: the system’s main failure modes and safeguards.
