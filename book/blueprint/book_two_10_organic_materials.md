# Book Two Module 10 Spec — Organic Materials

## Module
- Number: 10
- Topic: Organic Materials (forests/biomass/soils/regenerative resources)
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes

## Who This Affects
- Forestry, agriculture, landholders, indigenous communities, and ecosystem stewards.

## Prerequisites
- Regenerative vs produced goods distinction; externality fees; land/improvements split.

## Module Job
Specify how the framework treats regenerative resources and organic systems without incentivizing depletion or pretending everything is measurable.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Meterable: harvested volumes, land use changes, some pollution streams.
- Hard: soil quality dynamics, ecosystem complexity.

## Fee Structure Choice
- Treat cultivated production as productive activity (not taxed).
- Treat commons depletion/damage as externality fees where measurable.
- Treat land exclusion via LEF as the base layer.

## Mechanism Summary
- Rules for forests: harvested under rights/fees where commons-owned; private cultivation treated as production.
- Soil: avoid perverse incentives where depletion lowers fees.

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- Incentivizing depletion via measurement choices.
- Corruption via exemptions for “development”.
