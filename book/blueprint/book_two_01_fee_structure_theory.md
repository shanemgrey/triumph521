# Book Two Module 01 Spec — Fee Structure Theory

## Module
- Number: 01
- Topic: Fee Structure Theory
- Target length: ~2,500 words (variance allowed)
- Skippable: yes (must be readable standalone)

## Who This Affects
- Anyone implementing or evaluating any domain module (this is the “how to think” preface).

## Prerequisites (Minimal)
- From Part I: Nature/Civilization/Labor, Commons, Exclusion, Rent, LEF, Citizen Dividend, People’s Budget, “no taxes on productivity”.
- Glossary terms: commons, exclusion, rent, productive activity, externality fee, risk fee.

## Module Job (non-overlapping)
Explain why the same principle (“price exclusion/commons usage”) requires different fee structures across categories (land vs hydrocarbons vs durable materials vs spectrum, etc.), based on behavior and measurability.

## Inputs / Measurability
- Key question: what can be measured cheaply and audited?
- Key constraint: the measurement system must not create a bigger corruption surface than the rent it captures.
- Stable vs greenfield: what to do when registries and metering are weak.

## Fee Structure Choice
Introduce a small set of fee-structure archetypes:
- **Hold/exclude fee** (land-like): recurring price for exclusive control of a fixed-supply input.
- **Extraction rent capture** (finite resources): price/auction/contract mechanisms aimed at capturing scarcity rent and reducing throughput.
- **Metered usage fee** (water/commons infrastructure): priced per unit when usage is measurable.
- **Auctioned access rights** (spectrum): scarce access allocated via competitive bidding with periodic renewal/fees.
- **Externality fee** (atmosphere/biodiversity): priced damage/depletion when measurable proxies exist.
- **Risk fee** (social-cost internalization): priced predictable social cost (not general revenue).

## Mechanism Summary
- Start from the category: scarcity type, depletion dynamics, stock vs flow, substitutability, externalities, enforcement difficulty.
- Choose the fee archetype that (1) targets rent/commons usage, (2) is measurable, and (3) is hard to game.
- Treat parameters (caps, rates, thresholds) as polity choices with explicit failure-mode warnings.

## Tunable Parameters (Not “The Policy”)
- Fee adjustment caps (why caps exist; when to relax them).
- Target signals (utilization, buffer, throughput reduction, ecological proxy thresholds).
- Renewal periods for rights (spectrum, leases).

## Failure Modes & Safeguards
- “Measurement becomes the product”: gaming the metric.
- “Exemptions metastasize”: carve-outs kill rent capture.
- “Discretion returns”: overrides become corruption.
- Safeguards: transparency, audit trails, simple rules, constrained power.

## Interfaces (Where This Touches the System)
- All fee structures feed the same flow: collection → Citizen Dividend (first) → People’s Budget (optional funding).
- Each module must state what institutions and enforcement are assumed.

## Notes for Translation
- Keep terminology consistent; avoid idioms (“silver bullet”, “race to the bottom”, etc.).
