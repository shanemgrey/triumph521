# Claim Ledger (Claims → Evidence → Chapters)

Every major claim gets an ID so you can track where it appears, how it’s supported, and whether it’s safe to publish.

## Status Codes
- `SUPPORTED`: definition/architecture claim is settled and internally consistent.
- `ARGUED`: supported in-text via mechanism reasoning + thought experiments (no external proof required).
- `OPEN`: acknowledged as important but intentionally not “solved” yet (framed as design space / risk).
- `REMOVE`: claim is not safe / not needed.

## Claims

| Claim ID | Claim Statement | Support Type Needed | Status | Sources / Notes | Used In (Chapters) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-001 | Production requires the interaction of nature, civilization, and labor; treating these inputs as interchangeable creates category errors in economic reasoning. | definition + economic reasoning | SUPPORTED | Derived from `archive/onepage.md` framing; clarify as “model” not physics. | TBD |
| C-002 | Income from exclusive control of land/resources is structurally different from income from producing goods/services; it is exclusion-based rent rather than effort-based reward. | definition + thought experiments + concrete examples | ARGUED | Use simple contrasts (land vs factory; location premium vs improvement value). | TBD |
| C-003 | Much of land/location value is socially generated (civilization effects), so private capture of that value is a structural distortion rather than a reward for production. | mechanism reasoning + thought experiments | ARGUED | Keep empirical references optional; the core case is conceptual: location premium tracks collective inputs. | TBD |
| C-004 | A recurring Land Exclusion Fee (LEF) assessed on land value independent of improvements is designed to capture land rent and drive speculative land sale value toward zero while encouraging utilization. | incentive analysis + thought experiments | ARGUED | Phrase as design objective with clear mechanisms (vacancy pressure, holding cost, bid-for-use). | TBD |
| C-005 | Land valuation and fee-setting can be made algorithmic and auditable (rather than discretionary) using transparent inference rules and utilization signals. | mechanism design + feasibility argument | ARGUED | Must state assumptions; also include a low-data “greenfield” fallback path for rebuilding states. | TBD |
| C-006 | Captured land/resource rents can fund an equal per-capita Citizen Dividend that compensates citizens for exclusion and converts scarcity rents into shared income. | accounting logic + distribution mechanism | ARGUED | Real-world parallels are optional; the core support is the accounting and incentive logic. | TBD |
| C-007 | Dividend-first routing (rents → dividend → budgeting) reduces political capture by making diversion immediately visible and repeal personally costly. | institutional incentives | ARGUED | Support with logic about visibility and self-interest; avoid overpromising “capture-proof”. | TBD |
| C-008 | A People’s Budget (citizens set budget size and allocate) shifts accountability toward citizens and reduces capture compared to administrator-controlled tax spending. | institutional incentives + failure-mode analysis | ARGUED | Must include limits/caps and predictable failure modes (coordination, turnout, manipulation). | TBD |
| C-009 | Eliminating taxes on productive activity is the non-negotiable end state; during transition, taxes are reduced as rent capture + People’s Budget replace revenue functions and citizens are kept whole via dividend and reduced distortions. | transition logic + sequencing | ARGUED | Avoid claiming guaranteed welfare increases; keep claims conditional and mechanism-based. | TBD |
| C-010 | For finite extractive resources, the system can use monopoly–monopsony pricing (e.g., targeting a revenue-maximizing point) to capture rent while reducing throughput. | simplified intuition (Part I) + technical mechanism (Book Two) | ARGUED | Keep heavy math/IO theory in Book Two; Part I gets the intuition and why it’s not a “tax on work”. | TBD |
| C-011 | A compensatory transition using time-limited bonds for eliminated speculative land value can reduce resistance while preserving end-state incentives. | political economy + design constraints | ARGUED | Also present a “greenfield adoption” path that skips compensation when rebuilding from scratch. | TBD |
| C-012 | If land stops being a speculative asset, incentives and credit allocation shift away from land-backed leverage toward productive investment, reducing bubble pressure. | incentive analysis (keep empirical claims modest) | ARGUED | Present as expected direction, not as a guaranteed macro forecast. | TBD |
| C-013 | The system fails primarily through exemptions, algorithm tampering, or dividend diversion; transparency and dividend priority are non-negotiable safeguards. | institutional reasoning | SUPPORTED | Derived from `archive/core_spec.md` failure modes; may still want historical analogs. | TBD |
| C-014 | As AI/robotics reduce the role of human labor, rent capture alone may be insufficient if machine-owned productivity becomes the dominant value source; additional anti-monopoly/commons rules may be required. | scenario analysis + design space mapping | OPEN | Must be framed as “edge of AI” risk + next-step agenda, not as a solved mechanism. | TBD |
| C-015 | Different commons categories require different fee structures (land, hydrocarbons, durable materials, spectrum, atmosphere, water, etc.) because they differ in measurability, depletion dynamics, and market behavior. | mechanism taxonomy + thought experiments | ARGUED | This is the opening “fee structure theory” module in Book Two. | TBD |
| C-016 | Externality fees and risk fees fit the framework when they are measurable, rule-bound, and scoped to commons damage or predictable social costs (not used as general revenue or as taxes on productive activity). | definitions + examples + constraints | ARGUED | Must define “allowed fees” vs “productive taxes” crisply to avoid ambiguity. | TBD |
| C-017 | An estate/inheritance recapture mechanism can fit the framework if it targets non-productive windfalls and is framed as commons-derived value recapture (not a tax on productive activity). | legitimacy framing + mechanism sketch | ARGUED | Name/mechanism details belong in Book Two; Part I should only establish why it fits. | TBD |
| C-018 | A greenfield adoption path can allocate land rights via competitive auctions for annual LEF payments with algorithmic adjustment rules (e.g., CPI + 10% cap) that keep land transfer value near zero and maintain a healthy “land availability buffer”. | greenfield procedure + failure modes | ARGUED | Requires minimal institutions (ID, payments, enforcement, registry); detailed procedure in Book Two, including “too low/too high” signals. | TBD |
