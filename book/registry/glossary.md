# Glossary (Canonical Definitions)

Definitions live here. Chapters may *use* terms; they may not silently redefine them.

## Terms

| Term | Definition | Allowed Synonyms | Forbidden Synonyms / Metaphors | First Introduced (Chapter) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nature | The non-human inputs to production: land, location, minerals, energy, ecosystems—things not created by people. | natural endowments; land & resources (when clear) | “produced”; “earned” | TBD | Not “the environment” as politics; it’s an economic primitive. |
| Civilization | The collectively produced substrate that makes production possible: infrastructure, institutions, knowledge, networks, safety, markets. | public capital; social substrate | “the state” (when meant broader); “culture war” framing | TBD | Value often shows up as location premium. |
| Labor | Individually attributable human effort: time, skill, attention, creativity. | work; effort | “value” (as a catch-all); “virtue” framing | TBD | Labor can be paid without implying anything about morality. |
| Land | Location-exclusive space: a bounded place from which others can be excluded. Total supply is fixed. | location; site | “real estate” (when you mean land+improvements); “property” (too broad) | TBD | Land is not the building on it. |
| Improvements | Produced, depreciating additions to land (structures, buildings, cultivated capital) attributable to labor/capital formation. | structures; built capital | “land value” | TBD | In this system, improvements are not the base for rent capture. |
| Commons | The set of shared inputs and shared value that no individual produced alone (especially nature and the civilization-produced substrate) and from which exclusion should be compensated. | commonwealth; shared endowment | “collectivism” (as a label); “everyone owns everything” | TBD | In this book, “commons” is an accounting category first, a legal category second. |
| Exclusion | The enforceable power to deny others access to a location/resource (“you cannot use this”). | exclusive control; access control | “theft”; “violence” (unless discussing enforcement explicitly) | TBD | Exclusion is a mechanism, not a moral accusation. |
| Rent (economic rent) | Income derived from exclusive control of a scarce asset (land/resources), not from producing goods/services. | unearned rent; scarcity rent | profit; wages; “greed” | TBD | Use “rent” precisely to avoid “profit vs rent” confusion. |
| Land Exclusion Fee (LEF) | A recurring charge for exclusive control of land, assessed on land value independent of improvements and set to discourage vacancy/speculation. | land fee; location fee; (legacy: LUF) | property tax; improvement tax | TBD | Final label for this project: `LEF`. |
| Resource rent | The surplus value created by scarcity/demand for natural resources above extraction cost, captured for public distribution. | natural resource rent | “corporate profit” (unless decomposed) | TBD | Applies to finite extractive resources; regenerative cases vary. |
| Land & Resource Authority (LRA) | Public institution that collects land exclusion fees and captures resource rents using transparent rules; cannot self-fund and is budgeted via the People’s Budget. | rent authority | “central planner”; “bureaucrats set prices” | TBD | Emphasize algorithmic, auditable constraints. |
| Citizen Dividend | Equal per-capita distribution of captured land/resource rents, paid unconditionally and prior to budgeting. | dividend; per-capita dividend | welfare; handout | TBD | It converts higher land/resource prices into net public benefit. |
| Citizen | A member of the polity eligible to receive the Citizen Dividend; citizenship rules are a local policy choice. | polity member | “any resident” (unless explicitly chosen) | TBD | Default intent in this book: citizens-only eligibility to reduce migration incentives. |
| People’s Budget | A democratic budgeting system where citizens vote on total public spend and allocate it across programs/agencies. | citizen-directed budgeting | “central planning”; “politicians decide” | TBD | Designed to reduce capture by making funding citizen-controlled. |
| Budget Size Vote | A periodic vote that sets the total public budget for the next period. | budget vote | “politicians set the budget” | TBD | Default in this project: annual. |
| Allocation Vote | A periodic allocation of each citizen’s share of the public budget across agencies/programs. | budget allocation | “central planning” | TBD | Default in this project: quarterly updates are allowed. |
| Dividend-First Rule | The constraint that all captured rents flow to the Citizen Dividend before any government spending is funded. | dividend priority | “government grabs it first” | TBD | A trust and anti-capture safeguard. |
| Transition bonds | Time-limited bonds used to compensate legacy land/resource rightsholders for eliminated speculative value during transition, serviced from captured rents. | compensation bonds | “bailout” (unless specifically arguing that case) | TBD | Separates transition politics from end-state incentives. |
| Unitary elasticity point | The point on a demand curve where price × quantity is maximized; used as a pricing target in the resource-rent mechanism. | revenue-maximizing point | “price gouging” | TBD | Technical term; likely Book Two-only depending on audience. |
| Productive activity | Labor, exchange, and capital formation: actions that create goods/services rather than extract scarcity value from exclusive control. | production; productive work | “economic activity” (too broad) | TBD | Non-negotiable end state: do not tax this category. |
| Usage / service fee | A cost-linked charge for discrete use of a service or commons infrastructure (e.g., tolls), distinct from broad taxes on productive activity. | toll; service fee | “tax” (when it obscures the mechanism) | TBD | Allowed when practical and low-friction; should not become a backdoor productive tax. |
| Externality fee | A fee tied to measurable damage or depletion of commons systems (pollution, extraction impacts), designed to internalize costs rather than tax productive activity. | commons damage fee | “sin tax” (unless that’s the point); “tax on work” | TBD | Allowed category; must be measurable and rule-bound. |
| Risk fee | A fee tied to predictable, measurable social costs imposed by an activity (health, accidents, enforcement), designed to internalize risk rather than raise general revenue. | social risk fee | “moral punishment” | TBD | Allowed category; algorithmically tied to observed costs where possible. |
| Greenfield adoption | Implementing the system as a fresh architecture (e.g., for a rebuilding/failed state) without legacy transition constraints. | fresh start | “reform” (when you mean rebuild) | TBD | Requires minimal assumptions and a “low-data” implementation path. |
| Glide path | A staged transition from legacy taxation/property systems to rent capture + dividend + people’s budget. | transition plan | “shock therapy” (unless explicitly chosen) | TBD | Emphasize compensation and political lock-in. |
| Estate recapture (working) | A non-productive transfer mechanism that fits the framework by treating inherited windfalls as partially commons-derived and recapturable without taxing productive activity. | inheritance recapture | “estate tax” (when it triggers ideology before explanation) | TBD | Name and exact mechanism to be finalized in Book Two. |
| CPI (Consumer Price Index) | A reference index for general price inflation, used here only as a baseline for bounding fee adjustment rates. | inflation index | “cost of living” (when imprecise) | TBD | Mentioned as a possible cap anchor, not as “the policy”. |
| LEF adjustment cap | A rule that bounds how much Land Exclusion Fees may change per period (e.g., CPI + 10%) to reduce shocks while still allowing convergence to utilization targets. | fee change cap | “price control” (as a blanket accusation) | TBD | Cap is a parameter; the algorithm must still keep land transfer value near zero. |
| Land availability buffer | The intentional existence of some land offered at the algorithmic LEF with no takers at any given time; used as a price signal that transfer value is near zero. | unused-land buffer | “waste” (as default framing) | TBD | Analogous to “some unemployment” as a balancing signal; too much buffer indicates LEF is too high. |
| Machine intelligence (AI) | Automated intelligence and robotics that can substitute for human labor at scale. | advanced automation | “the singularity” (as default framing) | TBD | The book treats concentration of AI-owned productivity as a future risk case. |
