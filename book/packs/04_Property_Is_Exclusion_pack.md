# Chapter 04 Pack (Compiled Context)

This is the only context the Chapter Writer should use for drafting Chapter 04.

## Contract Excerpt (non-negotiables)
- Thesis: Charging for exclusion from the commons (land and natural resources), distributing the proceeds equally as a citizen dividend, and funding government through citizen-directed budgeting can preserve markets and private title while eliminating taxes on productive activity—and create a stable foundation for a future where human labor is less central.
- Audience: cross-ideological readers who believe incentives matter more than intentions and want a non-moralized, mechanical explanation.
- Tone: calm, precise, non-tribal.
- Must not: ideology signaling, moralizing, activist framing, jargon without definitions, idioms/wordplay that translate poorly, invented citations, empirical side-debates as persuasion anchors.

## Chapter 04 Spec (from `book/blueprint/04_Property_Is_Exclusion.md`)
- Job: Make exclusion legible as the core mechanism of property (without moralizing) and show why exclusion can be priced without abolishing ownership.
- Entry → Exit: accepts “commons value exists” but moral/identity frames → can describe property as enforceable exclusion and sees why exclusion implies compensation.
- Must include: property/title as socially enforced right to exclude; exclusion as an institutional service; neutrality (accounting, not punishment); stylized frontier → enclosure → closure model (explicitly labeled as model/pattern, not literal history); land scarcity first then a resources parallel; loss-of-exit-option poverty implication (define “poverty” before first use); bridge to rent (Chapter 05).
- Must not include: concrete history claims (dates/places); “land back” rhetoric; deep fee mechanics yet.
- Key claims: `C-002`, `C-019`.

## Required Claims (IDs)
- `C-002` (status: `ARGUED`): Income from exclusive control of land/resources is structurally different from income from producing goods/services; it is exclusion-based rent rather than effort-based reward.
- `C-019` (status: `ARGUED`): Once exclusion from land/resources is enforceable, poverty becomes structurally possible because access to subsistence requires payment; an equal per-capita dividend restores a baseline commons claim without requiring equal land ownership.

## Allowed Terms (Glossary Subset)
- Commons: The set of shared inputs and shared value that no individual produced alone (especially nature and the civilization-produced substrate) and from which exclusion should be compensated.
- Exclusion: The enforceable power to deny others access to a location/resource (“you cannot use this”).
- Poverty (book definition): Persistent material insecurity: lacking reliable access to basic needs (food, shelter, health, safety) and having too little slack to plan beyond immediate needs.
- Land: Location-exclusive space: a bounded place from which others can be excluded. Total supply is fixed.

## Continuity Snapshot
- Previous chapter summaries: TBD (chapters 01–03 not drafted yet); rely on the chapter specs for sequencing and term-introduction order.
- “Already covered” list: TBD.

## Writer Notes (inputs only; not prose)
- Label the model explicitly as stylized/pattern (not literal history; no dates/places; no “this happened everywhere” claims).
- Phase 1 (frontier/abundance): nature is “free” in the sense that the only cost is labor to find/take/use; the key feature is the exit option (move elsewhere when excluded).
- Phase 2 (enclosure/property): durable investment creates pressure for enforceable boundaries; explain property as a restriction placed on everyone else (the owner is the one person exempted from that restriction); make institutions visible (registries/courts/enforcement) as the mechanism that makes exclusion real.
- Phase 3 (closure): when the frontier closes, property lines function like tollbooths; scarcity + civilization growth turns access into a price; speculation becomes rational; rent becomes a dominant income channel as the value of exclusion rises.
- Required beat: tie loss of exit option to poverty becoming structurally possible; define “poverty” using the glossary definition before first use.
- Resources parallel (after land): use the “4 dollars of digging → 10-dollar bill” intuition to show why private control of high-value finite deposits creates incentive for rapid depletion; frame as incentive logic, not moral failure.
- Bridge requirement: end the section by pointing forward to Chapter 05, where exclusion income is named and defined as rent.

## Output Checklist
