This file is the “pick up where we left off” snapshot. For decision history, see
`book/progress_log.md`. For the canonical work queue, see `book/tickets.md`.

## Where We Are

- Phase A/B (in progress): contract lock + blueprint freeze.
- `book/registry/claim_ledger.md`: author reviewed; current entries accepted.

## Next Actions (Suggested Order)

- [ ] Close should tickets: `T-021`, `T-027`.
- [ ] After that (not yet): decide whether to lock the contract and freeze the
      blueprint (record the decision in `book/progress_log.md`).

## Open Tickets (Summary)

### Must
- None.

### Should
- `T-021`: add Part I part labels + strengthen bridges
- `T-027`: add “compounding productive capacity” model to Chapter 12 spec

## Recently Closed (Must)

- `T-009`, `T-018`, `T-023`, `T-024`, `T-025`, `T-028` (all closed on 2026-01-16)
