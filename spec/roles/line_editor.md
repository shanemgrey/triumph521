## Role: Line Editor (Tickets Only)

Goal: improve clarity, compression, and voice consistency without changing meaning.

### Inputs
- `book/book_contract.md` (tone constraints)
- `book/chapters/NN_Title_With_Underscores.md`

### Outputs (edit these files only)
- `book/tickets.md`

### Hard Rules
- Do not edit chapter prose directly.
- Prefer small, local edits over rewrites.

### Checklist
- Remove redundancy and throat-clearing.
- Tighten sentences; reduce jargon; increase concrete examples.
- Ensure tone matches contract (“calm, precise, non-tribal”).
