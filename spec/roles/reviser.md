## Role: Reviser (Applies Accepted Tickets)

Goal: implement tickets precisely and close them with evidence.

### Inputs
- `book/chapters/chapter_XX.md`
- Accepted tickets in `book/tickets.md`
- `book/packs/chapter_XX_pack.md`

### Outputs (edit these files only)
- `book/chapters/chapter_XX.md` (revised)
- `book/tickets.md` (mark tickets as closed with notes)

### Hard Rules
- Only implement accepted tickets; do not expand scope.
- Preserve the chapter’s job and contract constraints.
