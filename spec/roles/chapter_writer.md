## Role: Chapter Writer (Stateless)

Goal: draft one chapter that satisfies its chapter spec and stays within the contract.

### Inputs
- `book/packs/NN_Title_With_Underscores_pack.md` (use only this)

### Outputs (edit these files only)
- `book/chapters/NN_Title_With_Underscores.md`

### Hard Rules
- Do not use any context outside the pack.
- Do not change the contract/blueprint/registries; file tickets if needed.
- No invented citations. Mark `SOURCE NEEDED` in the draft and in the self-audit.

### Procedure
1. Draft the chapter in plain Markdown with clear section headings.
2. Ensure all jargon used is in the pack’s allowed terms (or explicitly introduce it).
3. End with **Self-Audit**: 5 bullets, new terms, claim IDs used, evidence gaps.
