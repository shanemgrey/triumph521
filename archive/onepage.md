Imagine you are born into a world where three things must exist before anything of value can be produced.

First, there is **nature**: land, location, minerals, energy, ecosystems. No one created these. They were already here.

Second, there is **civilization**: roads, cities, legal systems, markets, knowledge, networks. No individual built these alone. They exist because countless people, over generations, coordinated their effort.

Third, there is **labor**: human time, skill, attention, creativity. This is the only input that can clearly be credited to an individual.

Nothing of value exists without all three. But they are not the same kind of thing.

Labor is produced by individuals. Nature is not produced at all. Civilization is produced collectively.

Modern economies quietly treat these inputs as if they were interchangeable. They are not.

When someone earns income by producing goods or services, that income tracks effort and skill. When someone earns income by controlling access to land or resources, that income does not track effort. It tracks **exclusion**.

Owning a piece of land means telling everyone else: *you cannot use this*. The value of that exclusion does not come from the owner’s work. It comes from everything and everyone around the land — population, infrastructure, safety, markets, culture. As civilization grows, the value of exclusion grows with it.

That value currently flows to private owners. Not because they created it, but because the system allows it.

The same logic applies to oil, minerals, and other extractive resources. Whoever controls access captures value created by scarcity and demand, not by labor. The higher the price, the more society pays — and the more private actors receive.

There is another way to handle this.

Instead of allowing private actors to capture the value created by nature and civilization, society can charge for exclusive use. Not as a punishment. Not as a tax on work. But as compensation paid to everyone else for being excluded.

Every payment for land use or resource extraction goes into a single pool. That pool is split equally among all citizens as a **citizen dividend**.

As prices for land and resources rise, people are not harmed. They are compensated. Higher prices reduce waste and overuse, while higher dividends increase security.

Because this system charges for exclusion rather than activity, taxes on labor, trade, and investment can be reduced and eventually eliminated. Work becomes more rewarding. Investment becomes more productive. Speculation loses its advantage.

To prevent capture, the dividend is paid first. Only afterward do citizens decide how much of their own dividend to allocate to government through a **people’s budget**. Government becomes a service funded by citizens, not a gatekeeper funded by extraction.

This system does not abolish markets, private ownership, or profit. It removes one specific distortion: allowing individuals to privatize value they did not create.

The result is an economy where effort pays, access is priced honestly, shared wealth is shared, and prosperity grows without being siphoned upward.

That is the entire idea.
